Abstract:
Natural language processing dominates the field of data science in
The 21st century. The core of this thesis is sentiment analysis, a subfield
within natural language processing, that focuses on the classification
of text into positive, neutral, and negative categories based on the semantic 
meaning of the content. The two machine learning algorithms,
the probabilistic Naïve Bayes and the BERT model, are compared on
a labeled dataset consisting of texts from different domains. In previous
research, models were trained for a specific field (such as finance
news or book reviews). This thesis investigates how a generic model,
which has been trained on a diverse dataset, performs sentiment classification
across various topics. Consistent with previous research, the
transformer-based BERT model significantly outperforms the traditional
Naïve Bayes model. Due to having been trained on a diverse
dataset consisting of various types of text from different domains, the
performance of both models is worse than previous research suggests.
Contributing factors to this weaker performance are investigated in
this thesis, as the performance is examined in detail at the macro- and
micro-level.
